      <p>
        This tool was developed as a rudimentary implementation of a taxonomy and
        the governance plan. It was developed to help visualize the governance and
        taxonomy development process. With further time and development, it could prove
        valuable in managing the taxonomy as it scales. It has the potential to automate
        processes and bring together useful information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tool’s current capabilities include adding, searching, and deleting tags
        from a locally stored list. To be an effective collaboration tool, it would
        need the backing of a database such as AWS’s DynamoDB or SQL Server. The
        implementation of the retrieval/modification (CRUD) logic would need to be
        moved to a backend API. Additionally, import/export could be added in common
        CSV or Excel formats.
      </p>
      <p>
        A potential capstone project for next year would be to find a team to design,
        develop, and implement a tool that would work with the team's needs and interests.
        This tool was developed in a limited time frame and was an extension to the project’s
        original scope. Below is a list of extensions to add given additional investment in this tool.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Move tag data to a central cloud data table. (e.g. AWS DynamoDB, AWS Aurora)</li>
        <li>Move CRUD logic to backend APIs. (e.g. AWS API Gateway with AWS Lambda or AWS EC2)</li>
        <li>Incorporate a secure sign-in process so only intended users gain access. (e.g. AWS Incognito)</li>
        <li>Incorporate User/Group policies and protect certain operations like add/delete tags to admins. (e.g. AWS IAM)</li>
        <li>Add more robust validations prior to adding tags to the list.</li>
        <li>Add a review page, where a team member can approve/decline new tags prior to pushing them to production.</li>
        <li>Expand the table layout to include additional taxonomy column fields.
            <li>Allow users to show/hide fields of interest.</li>
        </li>
        <li>Enable the ability to modify tag entries already in the table.</li>
        <li>For large tables, add a pagination scheme instead of infinitely appending to a single page.</li>
        <li>Improve the search functionality by making it more scalable to large datasets.</li>
        <li>Include filters for tag attributes that span multiple entries.</li>
      </ul>
